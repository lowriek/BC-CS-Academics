                <h1 id="mission">Learning Objectives</h1>
				<p>The mission of the Computer Science program is to provide graduates with a solid foundation in computing concepts and skills that will enable them to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>achieve a detailed quantitative understanding of the computational aspects of human-made and natural systems;</li>
					<li>devise new computing techniques, and design new computing systems that effectively address problems across the spectrum of human inquiry and endeavor, taking ethical and social considerations into account;</li>
					<li>pursue graduate study or employment in a wide variety of fields that require computational reasoning.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Our program is intended to imbue students with a deep understanding of fundamental computing ideas that transcend particular computing technologies, an integrative view based on current research and practice, and a desire and readiness for continued learning throughout their lives.</p>
				<p>Through the Computer Science program, graduates should acquire:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>general problem solving skills, including the ability to effectively apply the techniques of problem abstraction and decomposition;</li>
					<li>an ability to devise correct and efficient algorithms, and to implement them in contemporary programming languages while making rational choices of information representation, manipulation, and presentation;</li>
					<li>an understanding of the mathematics required to model and to harness complexity and uncertainty;</li>
					<li>a knowledge of the design principles of contemporary computing machinery;</li>
					<li>an ability to communicate technical concepts to a wide audience.</li>
				</ul>
