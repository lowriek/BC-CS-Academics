						<p><b>Advisor:</b> Sergio Alvarez</p>
						<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
						<p><font size="4">Methods in natural language processing (NLP) often make use of handcrafted features or simplifying assumptions of language that work well for many tasks and allow for computational tractability. They can, however, fall short in expressing the full semantic and syntactic richness of natural language that is necessary for solving complex problems of language understanding. To ad- dress this shortcoming, artificial neural networks (ANN), robust computational models used for machine learning, have recently been applied to NLP in order to learn continuous-valued vector representations that capture some of the linguistic properties of words and even sentences. These representations have subsequently helped achieve state of the art performance in a number of tasks. In this thesis, I first introduce the motivation and basic concepts behind natural language processing and artificial neural networks. I then describe the representations that ANN approaches to NLP comprise and finally, I mention the latest developments at the cross-section of these two areas, along with the basic intuitions behind them.</font></p>

					<p><b>Advisor:</b> Robert Muller</p>
					<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
					<p><font size="4">As programming languages and the field of computer science develop, the question of program correctness and reliability becomes more prevalent in our field. How can we assure that programs execute as expected, and what errors can we catch before we reach them? Type systems provide a framework to give satisfactory answers to these questions, and more expressive type systems yield more reliable conclusions drawn from static analysis of a program. However, more complex systems are computationally expensive, so the difficulty lies in striking a balance between a type system's effectiveness and its practicality in implementation and in execution.</font></p>
					<p><font size="4">This thesis discusses the limits of simple type systems as well as the polymorphic lambda calculus that underlies Java's Generics. We provide an Ocaml implementation of a dependently typed, higher-order functional language, to display the benefits of this expressive system that catches errors before runtime many other systems cannot detect. This aims to be a simple, general ML implementation that does not rely on any language-specific features, so as to highlight the type system in its clearest form. The dependently typed lambda calculus is compared to other systems, with concrete examples and a discussion of its benefits and drawbacks.</font></p>

					<p><b>Title:</b> <a href="pdf/14Casinelli.pdf"><em> Evaluating and Implementing Recommender Systems as Web Services Using Apache Mahout</em></a></p>
					<p><b>Advisor:</b> Sergio Alvarez</p>
					<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
					<p><font size="4">In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of online content. Recommender systems software has emerged to help users navigate through this increased content, often leveraging user-specific data that is collected from users. A recommender system helps a user make decisions by predicting their preferences, during shopping, searching, or simply browsing, based on the user's past preferences as well as the preferences of other users. This thesis explores different recommender system algorithms such as User-User Collaborative and Item-Item Collaborative filtering using the open source library Apache Mahout. We simulate recommendation system environments in order to evaluate the behavior of these collaborative filtering algorithms, with a focus on recommendation quality and time performance. We also consider how recommender systems behave in real world applications. We explore the implementation of a web service that serves as a front end to a recommender system, keeping in mind our evaluation results, as well as ease of access to applications, and the overall user experience.</font></p>

					<p><b>Title:</b> <a href="pdf/14Dadgar-Kiani.pdf"><em> Interactive Mobile Simulation of Classical Electrodynamics using Finite Difference Methods</em></a></p>
					<p><b>Advisor:</b> Sergio Alvarez</p>
					<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
					<p><font size="4">Unlike other branches of physics that can be simplified to lower spatial dimensions in order to improve understanding for an introductory student, classical electrodynamics is innately a three-dimensional science. This introduces the need for an educational utility to simulate the otherwise complicated phenomena that occur in three dimensions. This thesis aims to address this need through an iPad application that allows users to construct custom simulations and interact with them through touch gestures. The application allows the user to simultaneously explore electromagnetic induction, circuit theory, electrostatic fields, and elementary particle systems. Since the application allows for a high level of customization, a versatile modeling technique was needed to numerically approximate the laws of electrodynamics, called Maxwells Equations. The finite difference time domain method is a general method of approximating differential equations by discretizing the space and time domain. Since this applications primary purpose is as an explorative and potentially educational tool rather than a lab utility,
					it uses techniques to favor temporal as opposed to numerical efficiency. Furthermore, the circuit implementation made use of various elementary graph algorithms such as depth first search in order to solve a circuit's equivalent matrix equation.</font></p>

					<p><b>Title:</b> <a href="pdf/14Valeri.pdf"><em> Local Sonic Positioning System</em></a></p>
					<p><b>Advisor:</b> William Ames</p>
					<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
					<p><font size="4">Based on recent innovations such as the Nintendo Wii and the XBox Kinect, gaming companies are looking to improve and drastically alter the way users interact with games. The Kinect uses cameras and image recognition algorithms to represent a user’s body motions as the movement of virtual objects in 3D space. The Wii uses accelerometers and gyroscopes for the same purpose. This thesis project explores the possibility of using a process similar to GPS to locate the position of an object and move it around in a virtual 3D environment. A GPS receiver can calculate its position because it can determine how far away it is from multiple satellites. This thesis proposes that given three speakers and a microphone, the distance between one of the speakers and the microphone can be calculated from the time it takes sound to travel from the speaker to the microphone. The position of the microphone can then be calculated by finding the distance between the microphone and each of the three speakers. By locating the position of the microphone consistently, the changes in position can be used as input for a video game, resulting in the movement of an object in a virtual 3D space.</font></p>

					<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
					<p><font size="4">As the internet and cloud services have pervaded our lives in nearly every aspect, one of the biggest issues facing the populace today is nding ways to protect our privacy. An important part of protection for the average user of a service is their privacy policy: essentially the only way today to let a client dene how their data is used by the server. But often a client is not given a choice, and sometimes their policy is not even followed. We present here an way of encrypting user data such that they rst create a privacy policy, and their data is protected from even the service unless their privacy requirements are met by the service.</font></p>

					<p><b>Title:</b> <a href="pdf/13crotty.pdf"><em> Low-Overhead Concurrency Control Using State-Based Transaction Scheduling</em></a></p>
					<p><b>Advisor:</b> Ed Sciore</p>
					<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
					<p><font size="4">NewSQL RDBMSs specifically target OLTP applications, attempting to combine the high performance of NoSQL systems with the ACID guarantees of traditional architectures. Of late, these RDBMSs have eschewed the standard design practices of their predecessors in favor of more streamlined and specialized techniques. One such innovation in vogue at present is the serial execution model, in which data is divided into optimally sized partitions that each own a single worker thread for processing. Research suggests that, in current main-memory systems, this approach actually outperforms customary concurrency mechanisms by providing maximal CPU utilization at minimal cost. However, the serial execution model makes stringent assumptions regarding the partitionability of datasets, and many common workloads do not possess such characteristics.</font></p>
					<p><font size="4">In order to better address these workloads, we present a low-overhead concurrency control model that does not rely on strict expectations about partitionability. Our design uses a novel state-based transaction scheduler to efficiently organize the concurrent execution of non-conflicting operations. We demonstrate that our model achieves optimal CPU utilization for the aforementioned workloads and out-performs other concurrency control strategies.</font></p>

					<p><b>Advisor:</b> William Ames</p>
					<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
					<p><font size="4">The digital world has revolutionized virtually every aspect of peoples' lives. Many professional illustrators have begun to use digital tools in order to simplify their drawing process and make it more efficient. There are many different software programs that artists use, each fitted to meet different needs, such as photo manipulation, painting, or animation. Although digital art is constantly evolving and expanding, and there is little research on how artists interact with digital media.</font></p>
					<p><font size="4">Communication is one of the areas in which technology has had the most profound change. People from anywhere in the world have the ability to contact each other at a moment's notice. This reality has lead to new, fruitful collaborations in a variety of fields. Thus far, there are no fully-functional artist tools that enable direct communication between artists. My thesis involves the planning and implementation of such a program.</font></p>
					<p><font size="4">I first conducted a digital arts survey to gather data on how current digital artists interact with the programs they are using, the way they use tools that are common among all digital art software programs, as well as the shortcomings of these tools and digital art in general. The survey was answered by both amateur and professional artists from online art communities, the majority of whom have been using art programs for over four years. Afterwards, I began programming a basic drawing program based on the results of the survey, and added networking capabilities.</font></p>

					<p><b>Title:</b> <a href="pdf/13kim.pdf"><em> Automatic Pitch Detection and Shifting of Musicial Tones in Real Time</em></a></p>
					<p><b>Advisor:</b> Sergio Alvarez</p>
					<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
					<p><font size="4">Musical notes are acoustic stimuli with specific properties that trigger a psychological perception of pitch. Pitch is directly associated with the fundamental frequency of a sound wave, which is typically the lowest frequency of a periodic waveform. Shifting the perceived pitch of a sound wave is most easily done by changing the playback speed, but this method warps some of the characteristics and changes the time scale. This thesis aims to accurately shift the pitch of musical notes while preserving its other characteristics, and it implements this in real time on an Android device. There are various methods of detecting and shifting pitch, but in the interests of simplicity, accuracy, and speed, a three step process is used. First, the fundamental pitch of a stable periodic section of the signal is found using the Yin pitch detection algorithm. Secondly, pitch marks that represent the local peak of energy are found, each spaced out by roughly one period (inverse of the fundamental frequency). Lastly, these marks are used in the Pitch Synchronous Overlap and Add (PSOLA) algorithm to generate a new signal with the desired fundamental frequency and similar acoustical characteristics to the original signal.</font></p>

					<p><b>Title:</b> <a href="pdf/13ricketson.pdf"><em> Logical Time Synchronization in Distributed Networks with Volatile Latency</em></a></p>
					<p><b>Advisor:</b> Robert Signorile</p>
					<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
					<p><font size="4">The ability to accurately synchronize logical time between nodes in a network is important for various applications such as data collection, distributed robotics, and gaming. Most existing algorithms for time synchronization, however, are either only applicable in networks with low, consistent latency, or that are not distributed in nature. This is suitable for computers perpetually connected to WiFi or wired networks, but for mobile, embedded devices connected through volatile-latency networks such as cellular networks and that often communicate in a distributed manner, these algorithms are less than ideal.</font></p>
					<p><font size="4">This thesis explores a new method for time synchronization in these types of networks, called the "Follower" algorithm, which is shown to be effective at adapting to rapid, inconsistent changes in latency and to be ideal for distributed networks where nodes are disconnected and reconnected constantly. The algorithm is evaluated through extensive virtual network simulations that directly compare its effectiveness against Cristian's time synchronization algorithm, and is also implemented in a physical network of minimalist Arduino-based devices to show its potential benefit for reducing cost and complexity in distributed sensor networks.</font></p>

					<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
					<p><font size="4">The limit of efficient computation is an interesting topic both from the perspective of practical knowledge and pure mathematics. We examine the effect of randomness on efficiency. Does a machine with access to random coin flips provide a means for more efficient algorithms? Empirically, there are a number of problems that are solvable by randomized algorithms for which no equally efficient classical algorithm is known. Despite this observation, there are theoretical results in computational complexity theory suggesting that randomness can always be eliminated without much loss in efficiency. We explore both options by implementing a randomized algorithm, but also working through the theory of derandomization. We then explore methods for decreasing the amount of randomness needed in our algorithms by using expander graphs as “pseudorandom objects.” The ideas developed about expander graphs are then exploited to implement an algorithm solving graph connectivity in logarithmic space.</font></p>

					<p><b>Title:</b><em> Relative Distributed Inertial Navigation Using Android Technology</em></p>
					<p><b>Advisor:</b> Ed Sciore</p>
					<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
					<p><font size="4">Sensors have been a part of computer science and human computer interaction for many years, with applications ranging from spaceship navigation systems, robotics, to gaming. In gaming specifically, the use of the accelerometer has been popularized by the Nintendo Wii, which uses an accelerometer and a gyroscope to allow the Wii controller to represent 3D objects in 3D environments, such as a golf club, tennis racket, or a sword. This thesis project investigates the ability to use Android technology in tandem with sensors on Android devices to be able to represent players themselves as objects in a 3D environment. By combining sensor principles with OpenGL ES, this thesis attempts to represent players themselves as objects in a 3D environment by implementing relative distributed inertial navigation. Inertial navigation investigates using the accelerometer, gyroscope, and various filtering techniques. This navigation is further specified to be relative and distributed, as the environment is an arbitrary 3D environment, positioning players relative to that environment, and is designed for multi-user interaction. The thesis combines techniques from inertial navigation, OpenGL ES, Android, and client-server interaction to implement a reasonable solution, and provides research alongside supporting design and implementation decisions, and ends by making conclusions about how to further the technology and possible real-world applications.</font></p>
