 			In CSCI 1101 you were introduced to the basics of programming.  You wrote some relatively simple programs, and your primary focus was getting your code to work.  In this course you will take a more sophisticated look at programming.  You will learn several useful ways to organize data within a program (such as lists, stacks, queues, and trees), some of which are quite clever.  Each of these data structures has its own advantages and disadvantages, and you will learn how to evaluate tradeoffs in order to determine which one is the best for a particular program.  And you will learn to think of programming as a two-stage process:  The design stage, in which you figure out what the program ought to be doing and what classes it requires, and the implementation stage, in which you determine which technique(s) should be used to implement each class and write the code for it.  The course will use the Java programming language, which will be taught at the beginning of the semester.

				CSCI 1102 introduced you to the basic concepts of object-oriented programming: classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.  In this course, we look at object-oriented programming from a higher level, and focus on the design of object-oriented software.  As an analogy, consider a list—it is a lot easier to understand its operations by drawing pictures than by looking at code.  Similarly, you will learn how to draw pictures to describe the design of an object-oriented program.  And from these pictures we can develop design rules, such as "separate the model from the view" and "program to interfaces".  We will also go over fundamental design patterns that give us a simple way to talk about complex interactions of classes.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		Another analogy is the difference between an architect and a building contractor.  An architect designs the building, and is responsible for its usability, aesthetics, and feasibility.  The contractor follows the plan, making low-level decisions about each component.  Both are professionals, but the architect gets to be more creative and is often more highly valued.  This course teaches you how to be a software architect.

				A database system is an amazingly sophisticated piece of software.  It contains (1) a language interpreter, for processing user queries; (2) query rewrite strategies, for transforming inefficient queries into more efficient ones; (3) complex algorithms for indexing data, to support fast access; (4) a separate file system from that of the operating system, for managing the disk efficiently; (5) recovery mechanisms, for ensuring database integrity when the system crashes; and (6) an ability to handle concurrent accesses from multiple users. In this course we examine the various algorithms, data structures, and techniques for implementing these features.  And to make these theoretical ideas concrete, we will also examine the Java source code for a real-life database system – first to see how it works, and then to write our own additions and improvements to it.

			This course will provide a broad introduction to software systems with emphasis on operating system design and implementation. Its objective is to introduce students to operating systems with main focus on resource management and interfacing issues with hardware layers. Particular emphasis will be given to process management (processes, threads, CPU scheduling, synchronization, and deadlock), (virtual) memory management (segmentation, paging, swapping, caching) with focus on the interplay between architectural components and software layers. If there is time, we will investigate and discuss these same issues for distributed systems. The course programming assignments will be in Java/C.

			Starting with a simple language of expressions, this course develops a sequence of progressively more expressive programming languages keeping in mind the conflicting constraints between the expressiveness of the language and the requirement that it be reliably and efficiently implemented. The course focuses on these essential concepts and the run-time behavior of programs. Type systems play an essential role. By understanding the concepts the student will be able to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of a language for a given application.

				When you log onto a secure web site, for example to pay a bill from your bank account, you need to be assured of certain things: Is your communication private? An eavesdropper should not be able to determine what information you and the bank are exchanging. Does the website you are communicating with really belong to the bank?  A third party should not be able to successfully impersonate the bank. Are you you? A third party should not be able to impersonate you and make payments from your account. Are the messages you and the bank receive from each other the same ones that were sent?  No one should be able to alter the messages in transit without this being detected.
			</p>
			<p>
				Behind the scenes, an extraordinary series of computations takes place to ensure that these security requirements are met. This course some sophisticated ideas from both mathematics and computer science that make it all work. We will begin the course with a look at some classical cryptographic systems that were in use before the advent of computers, then study modern block ciphers, both the general principles behind their construction and use, and some details about widely-used systems: the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).  These are symmetric systems in which the parties share some secret information (a key) used for both encryption and decryption.  Cryptography was profoundly changed by the invention, in the late 1970's, of asymmetric, or public-key cryptosystems, in which the two parties do not need to share a secret in order to communicate securely.  We will study public-key cryptosystems like RSA, cryptographic hash functions, schemes for digital signatures, and zero-knowledge identification schemes.  We'll finish the course looking at some real-world cryptographic protocols (for example, SSL), more speculative protocols (electronic elections or digital cash), and some different ideas for the construction of cryptosystems (quantum cryptography).

        	Algorithms are the basis of computing, and their study is, in many ways, the essence of computer science.  In this course we study several algorithm-creation techniques, such as "divide and conquer", "dynamic programming", and "be greedy". We shall also learn mathematical tools to help us analyze the efficiency of our algorithms.  These techniques are illustrated by the study of interesting algorithms of practical importance.

			The course can be taken multiple times for credit.
			This course covers new and cutting edge topics.  For the fall 2014 semester, we will study methods for using a computer to analyze natural (human) language.  We will use a combination of models from formal language theory (e.g. regular expressions and context free grammars) and statistics (e.g. hidden Markov models) to study the syntax and semantics of words and sentences in natural (especially English) language text.  We will also see how these methods can be applied to important problems such as extracting information from Web pages and other documents, question answering, and translating text from one human language to another.  The only prerequisite is CSCI 1102. We will cover the relevant material from CSCI 2243 and CSCI 2244 as necessary.
