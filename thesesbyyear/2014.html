			<p><b>Title:</b> <a href="pdf/14Aslam.pdf"><em> Learning Distributed Representations Of Natural Language with Artificial Neural Networks</em></a></p>
			<p><b>Advisor:</b> Sergio Alvarez</p>
			<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
			<p><font size="4">Methods in natural language processing (NLP) often make use of handcrafted features or simplifying assumptions of language that work well for many tasks and allow for computational tractability. They can, however, fall short in expressing the full semantic and syntactic richness of natural language that is necessary for solving complex problems of language understanding. To ad- dress this shortcoming, artificial neural networks (ANN), robust computational models used for machine learning, have recently been applied to NLP in order to learn continuous-valued vector representations that capture some of the linguistic properties of words and even sentences. These representations have subsequently helped achieve state of the art performance in a number of tasks. In this thesis, I first introduce the motivation and basic concepts behind natural language processing and artificial neural networks. I then describe the representations that ANN approaches to NLP comprise and finally, I mention the latest developments at the cross-section of these two areas, along with the basic intuitions behind them.</font></p>

			<p><b>Title:</b> <a href="pdf/14Baxter.pdf"><em> An ML Implementation of the Dependently Typed Lambda Calculus</em></a></p>
			<p><b>Advisor:</b> Robert Muller</p>
			<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
			<p><font size="4">As programming languages and the field of computer science develop, the question of program correctness and reliability becomes more prevalent in our field. How can we assure that programs execute as expected, and what errors can we catch before we reach them? Type systems provide a framework to give satisfactory answers to these questions, and more expressive type systems yield more reliable conclusions drawn from static analysis of a program. However, more complex systems are computationally expensive, so the difficulty lies in striking a balance between a type system's effectiveness and its practicality in implementation and in execution.</font></p>
			<p><font size="4">This thesis discusses the limits of simple type systems as well as the polymorphic lambda calculus that underlies Java's Generics. We provide an Ocaml implementation of a dependently typed, higher-order functional language, to display the benefits of this expressive system that catches errors before runtime many other systems cannot detect. This aims to be a simple, general ML implementation that does not rely on any language-specific features, so as to highlight the type system in its clearest form. The dependently typed lambda calculus is compared to other systems, with concrete examples and a discussion of its benefits and drawbacks.</font></p>

			<p><b>Title:</b> <a href="pdf/14Casinelli.pdf"><em> Evaluating and Implementing Recommender Systems as Web Services Using Apache Mahout</em></a></p>
			<p><b>Advisor:</b> Sergio Alvarez</p>
			<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
			<p><font size="4">In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of online content. Recommender systems software has emerged to help users navigate through this increased content, often leveraging user-specific data that is collected from users. A recommender system helps a user make decisions by predicting their preferences, during shopping, searching, or simply browsing, based on the user's past preferences as well as the preferences of other users. This thesis explores different recommender system algorithms such as User-User Collaborative and Item-Item Collaborative filtering using the open source library Apache Mahout. We simulate recommendation system environments in order to evaluate the behavior of these collaborative filtering algorithms, with a focus on recommendation quality and time performance. We also consider how recommender systems behave in real world applications. We explore the implementation of a web service that serves as a front end to a recommender system, keeping in mind our evaluation results, as well as ease of access to applications, and the overall user experience.</font></p>

			<p><b>Title:</b> <a href="pdf/14Dadgar-Kiani.pdf"><em> Interactive Mobile Simulation of Classical Electrodynamics using Finite Difference Methods</em></a></p>
			<p><b>Advisor:</b> Sergio Alvarez</p>
			<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
			<p><font size="4">Unlike other branches of physics that can be simplified to lower spatial dimensions in order to improve understanding for an introductory student, classical electrodynamics is innately a three-dimensional science. This introduces the need for an educational utility to simulate the otherwise complicated phenomena that occur in three dimensions. This thesis aims to address this need through an iPad application that allows users to construct custom simulations and interact with them through touch gestures. The application allows the user to simultaneously explore electromagnetic induction, circuit theory, electrostatic fields, and elementary particle systems. Since the application allows for a high level of customization, a versatile modeling technique was needed to numerically approximate the laws of electrodynamics, called Maxwells Equations. The finite difference time domain method is a general method of approximating differential equations by discretizing the space and time domain. Since this applications primary purpose is as an explorative and potentially educational tool rather than a lab utility,
			it uses techniques to favor temporal as opposed to numerical efficiency. Furthermore, the circuit implementation made use of various elementary graph algorithms such as depth first search in order to solve a circuit's equivalent matrix equation.</font></p>

			<p><b>Title:</b> <a href="pdf/14Valeri.pdf"><em> Local Sonic Positioning System</em></a></p>
			<p><b>Advisor:</b> William Ames</p>
			<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
			<p><font size="4">Based on recent innovations such as the Nintendo Wii and the XBox Kinect, gaming companies are looking to improve and drastically alter the way users interact with games. The Kinect uses cameras and image recognition algorithms to represent a userâ€™s body motions as the movement of virtual objects in 3D space. The Wii uses accelerometers and gyroscopes for the same purpose. This thesis project explores the possibility of using a process similar to GPS to locate the position of an object and move it around in a virtual 3D environment. A GPS receiver can calculate its position because it can determine how far away it is from multiple satellites. This thesis proposes that given three speakers and a microphone, the distance between one of the speakers and the microphone can be calculated from the time it takes sound to travel from the speaker to the microphone. The position of the microphone can then be calculated by finding the distance between the microphone and each of the three speakers. By locating the position of the microphone consistently, the changes in position can be used as input for a video game, resulting in the movement of an object in a virtual 3D space.</font></p>

			<p><b>Title:</b> <a href="pdf/14Watanabe.pdf"><em> privateBook: Encrypting User Data with Attribute-Based Encryption Using Privacy Policies</em></a></p>
			<p><b>Advisor:</b> Robert Muller</p>
			<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
			<p><font size="4">As the internet and cloud services have pervaded our lives in nearly every aspect, one of the biggest issues facing the populace today is nding ways to protect our privacy. An important part of protection for the average user of a service is their privacy policy: essentially the only way today to let a client dene how their data is used by the server. But often a client is not given a choice, and sometimes their policy is not even followed. We present here an way of encrypting user data such that they rst create a privacy policy, and their data is protected from even the service unless their privacy requirements are met by the service.</font></p>
