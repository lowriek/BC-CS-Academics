			<p><b>Author:</b> Jun Kawai</p>
			<p><b>Title:</b> <a href="pdf/99KawaiJun.pdf"><em> Gaze Detection Via Self-Organizing Gray-Scale Units</em></a></p>
			<p><b>Advisor:</b> Margrit Betke</p>
			<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
			<p><font size="4">We present a gaze estimation system that detects an eye in a face image and estimates the gaze direction by computing the position of the pupil with respect to the center of the eye. Our system is based on unsupervised learning. It creates a map of self-organized gray-scale image units that collectively describe the eye outline. Our approach is information-conserving.</font></p>

			<p><b>Title:</b> <a href="pdf/99JeristaPang.pdf"><em> Hidden Surface Removal</em></a></p>
			<p><b>Advisor:</b> William Ames</p>
			<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
			<p><font size="4">We essentially created several algorithms which are able to reduce the number of calculations required to render a scene in a three-dimensional environment. The core of these algorithms is the ability to "see" what the user can view through the window of the computer screen into the world, perform the calculations in only what the user can see, draw it to screen, and ignore the remainder of the environment.</font></p>

			<p><b>Title:</b> <a href="pdf/99CanhCao.pdf"><em> Computer Generated Holography</em></a></p>
			<p><b>Advisor:</b> William Ames</p>
			<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
			<p><font size="4">In the computer science field, a computer generated holographic image is computed by numerically simulating the physical phenomena of light diffraction and interference. It is possible for a computer software to calculate the phase of light of an object. In my thesis, I implemented a computer program that is able to generate holograms by computing the phase of light of different objects such as points, lines, and wire frames.</font></p>

			<p><b>Title:</b><em> Implementing Beta Unification</em></p>
			<p><b>Advisor:</b> Robert Muller</p>
			<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
			<p><font size="4">Principality of typings is the property that for each typable term, there is a typing from which all other typings are obtained via some set of operations. Type inference is the problem of finding a typing for a given term, if possible. Kfoury and Wells developed an algorithm for computing principal typings for finite-rank intersection types. The algorithm depends on a new notion of unification, what is called beta-unification. We develop the first implementation of the beta-unification algorithm.</font></p>
